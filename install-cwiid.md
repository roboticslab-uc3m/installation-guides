# Install CWiiD

In the past, we used CWiiD for interfacing with the Wiimote (Wii controller).

Official page: [link](http://abstrakraft.org/cwiid/).

This library is no longer maintained. See [Install XWiimote](./install-xwiimote.md) for a replacement.

## Install CWiiD (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcwiid-dev
```
