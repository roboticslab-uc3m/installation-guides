# Install NVIDIA drivers

## Install NVIDIA drivers (Ubuntu)

At time of writing, you can increment the number of options for NVIDIA drivers available in Ubuntu `Additional Drivers` (e.g. from `nouveau`/`384.111` to `nouveau`/`384.130`/`390.48`/`396.18`) by previously running:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
```
